		Cyclic-1.12.2-1.20.0.jar:
			Updated 'block placement' logic through the entire mod, so things like building scepters and machines place blocks and keep their NBT data (like shulker boxes) as well as relative player directions, also improved compatibility with any blocks having special onItemUse logic/metadata.
			Workbench now quickly and cleanly syncs between multiple players using it at the same time.
			Excavate no longer allows tools to go into negative durability (correctly uses native attemptDamageItem to handle unbreaking enchant, tool damage, and tool breaking).
			GPS Marker now stores specific location of the hit within the block, the players facing direction, and the block-face clicked on (shows on tooltip while holding sneak)
			Structure Builder GUI changed, removed offset sliders and replaced with GPS slot; removed rotations value.
			Structure builder now optionally uses the GPS markers, so you can target an offset location and set the orientation of rotating blocks such as stairs.

			Structure builder has a new Horizontal Cylander building mode.
			Renamed Cyclic building scepter to Ranged Building Scepter; it now renders an outline of the distant block that it will place.

			Fixed water candle sometimes spawning mobs in the ground or creating other duplicate blocks.
			All dynamyte now uses ExplosionEvent.Start event to allow other mods to hook and cancel explosions if needed.

			Ender Library now checks for enchanted books of stack size != 1 for mod compatibility.
			Improve Storage Bag button tooltips for useability.
			Storage Bag deposit updated to use capabilities (more compatible with more modded inventories for example AA Crates).
